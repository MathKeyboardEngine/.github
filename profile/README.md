### License

The MathKeyboardEngine repositories have the most permissive license available: the "BSD Zero Clause License" ([0BSD](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/0bsd/)). This license [is equivalent](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/805) to other licenses, like:

- "MIT No Attribution License" ([MIT-0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit-0//)).
- "The Unlicense" ([Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/)).
- "CC0" ([CC0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0/)).

It allows for commercial + non-commercial use, closed source + open source, with + without modifications, etc.

*Note:*<br/>
The "ISC License" is a shorter version of the "MIT License", which are equivalent. Both have the condition

> (...), provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.

The "BSD Zero Clause License" does not have this condition. It is therefore more permissive than the ISC License and MIT License, but besides that they are all equivalent.
```
"MIT License" -> "MIT No Attribution License"
     =                     =
"ISC License" -> "BSD Zero Clause License"
```
